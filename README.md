## ⭐ [REDACTED]

This year I was gainfully employed by an organisation that kept everything behind closed doors. Proprietary code, private repos, NDAs — you know the drill.

I can confirm that code was, in fact, written. Lots of it. You'll just have to take my word for it. 🤷

- Enterprise Git workflows (the kind with 47 approvers)
- The art of writing Jira tickets about Jira tickets
- How to mass-produce mass-produced mass-produced mass-produced [documentation about documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- Coffee-driven development (CDD)

# 2023

## ⭐ [REDACTED]

This year I was gainfully employed by an organisation that kept everything behind closed doors. Proprietary code, private repos, NDAs, the whole lot.

I can confirm that code was, in fact, written. Lots of it. You'll just have to take my word for it. 🤷

Here's a [comprehensive summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) of what I learned:

- Enterprise Git workflows (the kind with 47 approvers)
- The art of writing Asana tickets about Asana tickets
- How to write [documentation about documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- Coffee-driven development (CDD)

If you're a recruiter, I promise I was very productive. [Here's proof.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
